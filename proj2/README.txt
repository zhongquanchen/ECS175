Notice:
I separate 4 screen in this project. Each screen shows different perspectives.

Screen iv. will show the original object which I convert 3D object into 2D and display on the screen.

Screen i. will show the object's XY perspective. Horizontal line represent x axis, vertical line represent y axis.

Screen ii. will show the object's YZ perspective. Horizontal line represent Y axis,
vertical line represent Z axis.

Screen iii. will show the object's XZ perspective. Horizontal line represent X axis, vertical line represent Z axis. 



How to run:
.Follow the instruction stated in the interface.
.Translation maybe out of bound. Suggest input value should less than 1.

.When press 4 in the interface it will automatically save the newest data into output.txt file and it will exit the program.
